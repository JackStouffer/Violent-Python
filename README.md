*Don't be a moron, please don't use this for something illegal.*

This is code that I am writing by following the "Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers" book. The code is not an exact copy because most of the code in the book is very un-pythonic, but they perform roughly the same tasks.

Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
